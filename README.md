# reodash === 'reduce lodash'

[Lodash](https://lodash.com/) is a great library and has made the adoption of functional programming easier in javascript world. It was itself inspired by [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/), of course.

Implementing lodash methods by yourself is a fun exercise, which i think every javascript programmer should try to do. But what about implementing lodash methods just using a single function - `reduce`? Is it even possible? I am starting the journey to find out.

P.S. - `reduce` has super powers and the earlier you realize it, the better.
